Use this to get a new computer up and running quickly. Created and tested for a Mac.

Built off mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git. This is still a WIP.

### My Setting Up Notes
- Adjust some [recommended defaults](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/)
- Make bash the default shell - newer macs come with zsh as default. `chsh -s /bin/bash`. Then start a new shell.
- You can also [upgrade](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba) your bash version in the process.
- Install Homebrew https://brew.sh/
- Run bootstrap.sh
- Run brew.sh
- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Visual Studio Code Extensions: `cat vscode/ext.txt | xargs -n1 code --install-extension`
- Font [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com/)
- Visual Studio Code settings.json
- Install NVM https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm (Or Volta, or manage node versions [manually with brew](https://notiz.dev/blog/how-to-manage-multiple-node-versions-on-mac#installing-node-via-homebrew))
