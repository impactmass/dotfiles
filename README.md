Use this to get a new computer up and running quickly. Created and tested for a Mac.

Built off mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git. This is still a WIP.

### Usage

1. First, make bash the default shell - newer macs come with zsh as default. `chsh -s`. You can also [upgrade](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba) your bash version in the process.

2. Install Homebrew https://brew.sh/
3. Install NVM https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
4. Run bootstrap.sh
5. Run brew.sh
